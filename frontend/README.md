# CHALLENGE'S FRONTEND :milky_way:

## Introduction

Oh...This one is more complicated. But to facilitate the visualization of my approach in this topic that I have always complicated myself (frontend), I will create a timeline and you can see what happened and how I got to the final result.

### Day 1:

  * Started doing the routes, importing fonts, images and configuring the project. Started doing the routes, importing fonts and images and configuring the project. I started to write the CSS with `` styled-components``, since it is, in my opinion, much better and the code get's prettier.

  * Then the fight started, how would I position everything? How to create containers and how to position them on the screen? I wanted to create a navigation bar that would be at the top of the screen and follow me when I scrolled down, how da hell would I do that?

  * So I started to search for code that did what I wanted to do, and I found it, but considering my inability with CSS, I dropped the styled-components and wrote everything with root CSS.

### Day 2:

  * My internet was going back and forth, but ok, I found a repository that would help me create my navigation bar, although it didn't look the way I imagined it, it was good enough and I could change it to create what I had proposed to create.
  
  * So I started getting along with CSS again. With a base good to go, I could code my way into what the challenge demands.

  * At the end of the day it was really nice, i had found others repositories that would contribute for my goals, but then i started to fight with other people code instead.

### Day 3:
  
  * After a lot of documentation and trials and errors and crashes on my internet, I decided it would be time to finish this part and go to my containers in Docker, create a nice README for the user, in this case, you, who are reading this now.

  * I wanted to clear the code and deliver something that was, at least, pleasant to read. I don't think that frontend code is pleasant to read, and I can think of ways to improve that. But I need more knowledge, need more study. So that is what I will do for now on.


### Without a doubt, frontend is something that deserves my attention. React is very good to work with, but you can't exploit it if I don't have CSS skills. Certainly, when we speak again I will be better on the subject.
