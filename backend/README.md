# CHALLENGE'S BACKEND :milky_way:

Without a doubt, that was my favorite part! Javascript on the server has its beauty and I really enjoyed developing it.

Indeed, there is nothing much to talk about, in a few hours I created the backend and it was running the way it is now. It's not perfect, obviously, I can point things that I, now, would do better. But now is high noon and I have to deliver that the way it is.

I would, for example, code better data structure and intensify a little the abstraction. Not because I would need the abstract side of it, but as a exercise.

My idea for the database was basically: save the file name and save the file in the uploads folder, the frontend would upload and save the file name in the bank and the file on disk, using the name of the bank file I would pull the image, from the disk to the frontend.

The GET in the bank was not created because i didn't start the integration between frontend and backend
